### Setup

1. [Download wordpress-lightning-paywall.zip](https://github.com/shesek/wordpress-lightning-paywall/releases/download/latest/wordpress-lightning-paywall.zip)

2. Install and enable the plugin on your WordPress installation.

3. Under the WordPress administration panel, go to `Settings -> Lightning Paywall` to configure your Lightning Strike server URL and API token.


### Usage

Add `[paywall AMOUNT CURRENCY]` in the place where you'd like the post to cut-off for non-paying users.

For example: `[paywall 0.0005 USD]` or `[paywall 0.00000005 BTC]`. All the currencies on BitcoinAverage are supported. BTC amounts can have up to 11 decimal places (milli-satoshis precision).

You may also specify a custom message and button text, as follows: `[paywall 0.005 ILS text="Please pay to continue reading." button="Alright, I'll pay!"]`. This will show up as:

Once the user makes the payment, the page will automatically refresh and the paywall access token will be appended to the URL. The user can bookmark this URL to return to the content later.
The token does not currently ever expire.

This will look something like: `http://some.blog/trusted-third-parties-are-security-holes/?paywall_access=2bgduhk48gkk480sksoowkssggc0wcokwws0c8k8k8s04wc0gs`

Note that anyone with this URL will be able to access the content. There are currently no restrictions in place to prevent links from being shared.
